            <p>ePortfolios, powered by Digication, are a type of digital portfolio utilized by students and faculty to document their professional development and establish a positive online presence. With an ePortfolio, students and faculty can create online archives of their acheivements, professional experience, academic work, personal hobbies and more. ePortfolios can be used as an extension of a resume to market yourself to prospective employers.</p>
            <p>Here is an example of a <a href="https://stonybrook.digication.com/rahul_agasthya/Welcome/published">ePortfolio.</a></p>
            <p>A well designed, informative and inviting personal Web site is an essential tool for any University student. A good personal site represents yourself online, providing a succinct summary of your academic career accented with personal style. It lets potential employers, grad schools, and other academics know a bit about your academic experiences, i.e. the courses you’ve taken and the projects you’ve worked on, while providing some details that let others know you are an interesting person who cares about the proper presentation of your work.</p>
            <p>The process of making a good ePortfolio can, in part, be automated, which is the point of this project. We are to make an application that makes the generation of such a site a breeze for any student so that they do not have to be experienced in Web design or programming. Using our tool, a well-designed, colorful, informative site can be generated using content entered by a student user, where they may customize the site in all sorts of ways. The site could then be moved to a Web server to be shared with the world.</p>
            <p>This application is available on BitBucket <a href="https://bitbucket.org/RAGASTHYA/eportfolio-generator">here.</a></p>

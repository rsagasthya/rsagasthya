            <p>Climate change is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when that change lasts for an extended period of time (i.e., decades to millions of years). Climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions, or in the time variation of weather around longer-term average conditions (i.e., more or fewer extreme weather events). Climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions.</p>
            <p>Certain human activities have also been identified as significant causes of recent climate change, often referred to as "global warming."</p>
            <p> The aim was to compile a documentary, to increase awareness about this deadly future and to bring to light the steps taken by certain governments to minimize their contribution towards Climate Change and Energy Crisis.</p>

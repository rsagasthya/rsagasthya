            <p>The Duke of Edinburgh's Award is the generic name for a youth awards programme founded in the United Kingdom in 1956 by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, that has since expanded to 144 nations. The awards recognise adolescents and young adults for completing a series of self-improvement exercises modelled on Kurt Hahn's solution to the "Six Declines of Modern Youth."</p>
            <p>In the United Kingdom the programme is run by The Duke of Edinburgh's Award, a royal charter corporation. A separate entity, The Duke of Edinburgh's International Award Foundation, promotes the award abroad and acts as a coordinating body for award sponsors in other nations, which are organised into 62 National Award Authorities and a number of Independent Operators. Award sponsors in countries outside the United Kingdom may title their awards Duke of Edinburgh's Awards, though the recognition also operates under a variety of other names in countries without a historic link to the British monarchy, or that have severed such links.</p>

            <p>The Duke of Edinburgh's Award programmes take between one and four years to complete, and they must be completed by the participant's twenty-fifth birthday. There are around 300,000 participants annually. The programmes are at three progressive levels which, if successfully completed, lead to a Bronze, Silver or Gold Duke of Edinburgh’s Award.</p>
            <p>With assistance from adult Leaders, participants select and set objectives in each of the following areas:
            <ul>
                <li>Volunteering: undertaking service to individuals or the community.</li>
                <li>Physical: improving in an area of sport, dance or fitness activities.</li>
                <li>Skills: developing practical and social skills and personal interests.</li>
                <li>Expedition: planning, training for and completion of an adventurous journey in the UK or abroad.</li>
                <li>At Gold level, participants must do an additional fifth Residential section, which involves staying and working away from home for five days, doing a shared activity.</li>
            </ul>
            To achieve an award, the participant must work on each section for a minimum period of time, and must be monitored and assessed by someone with knowledge of the chosen activities. Each progressive level demands more time and commitment from participants: Bronze 3–6 months; Silver: 6–9 months; Gold: 12–18 months. Participants are required to show regular activity and commitment to the award for the duration of their DofE programme, which is usually at least one hour per week.</p>

            <p>I was awarded the Bronze Medal, by participating in Volunteering at a School for Blind children (Shri. Ramanashri School for the Blind) and completing an overnight camping in the rural areas of Bangalore. Also, as a part of this program, I participated in Swimming and Aeromodelling.</p>

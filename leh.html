            <blockquote>Travel makes one modest, as you see what a tiny place you occupy in the world. It is one of the affirming things we can do to ourselves.</blockquote>
            <p>There is nothing more beautiful than the works of Mother Nature. One such master piece is Ladakh district in North-Eastern part of Jammu-Kashmir, India. The Seven Days we spent, the Nineteen Thousand feet we climbed and the Hundreds of Kilometres we drove, remains treasured.</p>

            <p>Arrival in Kushok Bakula Rinponche Airport, Leh was itself rugged. Short runway, mountainous terrain made touchdown seem impossible, but the pilots’ skill left us awe struck. We were welcomed by the clean and energetic air of Ladakh range of the Himalayas, well maintained roads, and the unlimited hospitality of the locals.</p>
            <p>We were introduced to the life, culture and tradition of the Buddhists through their marvellous monasteries, like the Alchi Gompa, Likhir Monastery and the Hemis Monastery. The access walk ways showcase some excellent souvenirs, like The Tibetan Singing Bowls, Chimes, Busts of Buddha, etc.</p>
            <p><b>NUBRA VALLEY: </b></p>
            <p>The next day we headed to Nubra Valley which is about 120 km from Leh. Heavy snowing had blocked the roads to the valley, but were cleared by 11 am. So, we started off on our “5 Hour Drive” which lasted for more than 10 hours. We first stopped at South Pullu for a quick refreshment and decided to proceed straight to Nubra. This journey was an adventure by itself, as we had to drive through KardungLa, which is at an altitude of 18380 feet (5600 metres), making it the highest motor able road in the world. The roads were narrow, rugged and slippery because of the recent heavy snowfall. The vehicular movement was very slow. Admiring the scenic beauty of the mountains we drove towards K–Top at snail speed. Here, I learned that KardungLa was a part of the traditional Silk Route that connected the Eastern World with the West.</p>
            <p>The next day, after clicking loads of photographs, we headed out to the sand dunes of Nubra Valley, which is a cold desert amidst the Ladakh range and the Karakoram Range. Dressing like local Ladakhis and the Bactrian camel ride were main attractions. After a ride on the double humped Bactrian Camel, we drove back to Leh.</p>

            <p><b>PANGONG LAKE: </b></p>
            <p>Our next road trip was to Pangong Lake, via ChangLa, at an altitude of 17688 feet (5400 meters), the third highest motor able road. On the other side, we were welcomed by the Madaras regiment of the Indian Army. It was late afternoon when we arrived in Pangong Lake. We stayed in tents adjoining the Lake, with temperatures as low as –7°C (19°F). I saw the national flag which was hoisted by the Border Security Force of India near the China Border. I also learned that only 25% of the Lake belongs to India, while the rest is in China.</p>

            <p>Soon our trip was coming to an end. We pulled out our bags with regret, as we never wanted to leave. We bid “Julley” to both of our drivers who were extremely helpful, kind and caring. Within a few hours the mountains were replaced with buildings, the clean air was polluted, the silence was broken as we touched down in New Delhi.</p>

            <blockquote>Joy is in the Journey, not at its end. The exquisiteness of Leh-Ladakh is evergreen and just makes you feel good.</blockquote>

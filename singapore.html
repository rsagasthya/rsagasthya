            <p><b>13 June 2011... </b></p>
            <p>Students from all over South-Asia had gathered to participate in the eventful and educative Science Camp in the National University of Singapore. We were briefed on the entire programme and the University.<p>
            <p>The next topic was about Public Holidays of Singapore by Prof. Helmer Asiaken. He explained the mathematics behind different holidays of Singapore i.e. the three national holidays New Year’s Day, Labour Day and National Day, and eight cultural holidays of Chinese, Hindu, Muslim and Christian. They are Chinese New Year (CNY) and the Second Day of CNY, Good Friday, Vesak Day (Birthday of Buddha), Deepavali, Christmas Day, Hari Raya Puasa (Eid ul-Fitr) and Hari Raya Haji (Eid ul-Adha).</p>
            <p>The next topic was Nanotechnology, by Prof. Sow Chorng Haur, which was an exciting and an amazing experience. We were taught about the Nanoscale and also to draw pictures of atoms and molecules. We were also shown colloidal gold in different colours. He showed us a small experiment. He took a block of ice and a hammer. He stroked the hammer to the ice, obviously the ice broke. But he took another block of ice but this one was covered with layers of tissue paper and stroked it with the same hammer. Amazingly it never broke. He explained that the tissue binds the ice layer together and prevents it from breaking. He also showed us writing on a pin head with atom size small letters. With this technology the world's information could stored on a pinhead. He also showed us the applications of carbon nano tube and wound up his lecture.</p>
            <p>We then departed to Sentosa Island-Asia’s Favourite Playground. We saw the Dolphin Lagoon Show and witnessed the best Dolphin and Seal performance. We also visited the Underwater World and were spell bound to see millions of marine creatures under one roof.</p>
            <br/>

            <p><b>14 June 2011... </b></p>
            <p>We had a practical work to do. We were taken to the demo lab in Faculty of Science (FoS). We saw many experimental setups about resonance, static electricity, speed and momentum, density, wave transmission, working of the Singapore MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) and electromagnetism. We constructed a Homopolar motor too.<p>
            <p>The next activity was DNA and Forensic Science in Singapore Science Centre, where we were taught how to use a Micro Pipette and also to match blood samples. We were given a case about a murder (A Real Incident) and were asked to match some of the given blood samples.</p>
            <br/>

            <p><b>15 June 2011... </b></p>
            <p>We proceeded to Raffels Museum on Bio Diversity (RMBR). We saw many animal specimens and we had a small lecture on the classification of animals. We had a small quiz and we had to identify the animal group and one of its characters. It was a fun filled activity and all of us enjoyed it.<p>
            <p>We then boarded a bus to NeWater Visitor Centre, a part of Public Utilities Board of Singapore. We saw water was recycled to its portable form by different processes. We were also given samples of the water.</p>
            <br/>

            <p><b>16 June 2011... </b></p>
            <p>We had the final workshop on the CMAAC labs on chromatography. We saw how a Scanning Electron Microscope works.<p>
            <p>Then we saw many labs on chromatography and how many liquids were purified. Next we saw the Transmission Microscope and Light microscope. We saw a picture of the human nail and water droplet on the lamina of a lotus leaf.</p>
            <p>We then proceeded for a city tour of Singapore. We saw the Supreme court of Singapore, Istana (Residence of the President and Parliamentary Building of Singapore) and Esplanade. We alighted the bus in China Town and walked through the streets, shopping for souvenirs for friends and family.</p>
            <br/>

            <p><b>17 June 2011... </b></p>
            <p>The final day of the camp. We the most awaited Science Quiz about all the topics taught in the camp. It was an exciting two hours to get the correct answers and try to make it to the finals.</p>
            <p>The session was amazing and was followed by the presentation of the certificate of completion to all the 114 participants.</p>
            <p>Then a member from the Admission branch of NUS came up to all of us and spoke about the admission in that University.</p>
            <p>We then left for Mustafa Mall. We also visited the Clementi mall and Little India.</p>
            <br/>

            <p><b>18 June 2011... </b></p>
            <p>This was the last day in Singapore. We were packed for the journey back home. </p>
            <p>We headed towards Singapore Changi Airport. We bid all our new friends adieu and proceeded towards check-in for our flight SQ502, back to Bangalore but yet those seven days made it impossible for us to forget the trip, the new friends, the University or Singapore itself.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The trip gave me an exposure to Global Education. I met many people, from different cultures, different ethinicities and different nations. I learned what it means to represent a school, a city or even an entire country. In short, the trip to the National University of Singapore was a stepping stone for my future education in the United States of America.</p>
